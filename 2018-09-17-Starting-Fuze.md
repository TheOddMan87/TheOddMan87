What I did and learnt in the lesson
We started by trying to connect the fuze program to our monitor, and with a little bit of help from the teacher we managed to do it. Then we started up the program, and we learnt how to write letters into it, write letters at spaced intervals, make the letters pink and make the background grey.</td>
